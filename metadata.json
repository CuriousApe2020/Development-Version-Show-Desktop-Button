  "description": "I had the need of a 'show-desktop-button'. I found an extension that does exactly what I want, but it was quite old. I tried to update it a little bit and make it work. I'm still learning how to make extensions, so all the credits go to the original author and his collaborators.\nThis is the original extension: extensions.gnome.org/extension/64/show-desktop-button/\nI hope you will appreciate this kind of fork and that also the author will appreciate the efforts to keep his work alive!\n\nv5:\n1 - added support for gnome-shell 3.38\n2 - only unminimize those windows that weren't already minimized by the user (windows-like behaviour)\n3 - REMOVED FEATURE: the indicator will only appear on the right side of the panel\n\nv6:\n1 - minor fixes so that, when the extension is disabled, no error is (should be?) displayed\n\nv7:\n1 - Added rough support for changing indicator position on the panel",
