  "description": "I had the need of a 'show-desktop-button'. I found an extension that does exactly what I want, but it was quite old. I tried to update it a little bit and make it work. I'm still learning how to make extensions, so all the credits go to the original author and his collaborators.\nThis is the original extension: extensions.gnome.org/extension/64/show-desktop-button/\nI hope you will appreciate this kind of fork and that also the author will appreciate the efforts to keep his work alive!",
